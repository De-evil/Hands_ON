Random Advice App
This is a simple React application that provides users with random pieces of advice. The app fetches advice from the Advice Slip API and keeps track of how many pieces of advice the user has viewed.

Features
Dynamically fetches advice from the Advice Slip API.
Displays the advice to the user in real-time.
Keeps a count of how many pieces of advice have been read.
Built with React, leveraging hooks like useState for state management.
How It Works
On initial load, the app displays a default message: "Please Click Button to Get Advice".
When the "Get Advice" button is clicked:
The app sends a request to the Advice Slip API to fetch random advice.
The advice is displayed dynamically on the screen.
A counter increments to track how many pieces of advice have been viewed.
The counter and advice updates are seamless, thanks to React's state management.
